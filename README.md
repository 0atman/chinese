## Leave Suggestions as Github Issues!

For the love of God, if you have a better way of algorithmically relating Chinese characters please tell by leaving a Github issue. What I would love is a way to automatically say "well if you know this character why not learn related one".

### What I've Tried

Radical usage follows the Pareto Principle and stroke follow normal distribution, they don't really chunk characters well.
