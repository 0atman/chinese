## Leave Suggestions as Github Issues!

For the love of God, if you have a better way of algorithmically relating Chinese characters please tell by leaving a Github issue. What I would love is a way to automatically say "well if you know this character why not learn this related one". I did not make the json by hand, but used Google sheets and a program called Intemplator. As long as I can create a csv of 'character' -> 'label that helps create relations' I can extend this system.

### What I've Tried

Radical usage follows the Pareto Principle and stroke count follows a normal distribution, they don't really chunk characters well.
